# hello-world
My first repository
Hello everyone, my name is BÃ¬nh Long and I just start to study about git so please help me more in thee future
I like a girl but I can't tell anybody that I like her cause I'm too shy and I can't speak to her normally. And even if I could talk to her normally, I still couldn't confess to her cause I'm nothing to her. I'm just her friend.  
I like chess and soccer, I love reading manga and novel, especially thriller. I like to come around with my friends. I reallly love my time in high school now. I have met so many people who have become my best friends. I want to prolong my time in high school but we can't defy Mother nature, right? I want to make this time become the most beautiful time in my life. I hope in the future we will still be friends forever.
I want to become the best, the greatest programmer in the world.
